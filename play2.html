       <h4 class ="HORTENSIO">HORTENSIO</h4>

        <p class="paragraph">Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
            And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
            Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:
            And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich
            And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,
            And I'll not wish thee to her.</p>

     <h4 class="PETRUCHIO">PETRUCHIO</h4>

     <p class="paragraph">Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
        Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
        One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
        As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
        Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
        As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd
        As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,
        She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
        Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
        As are the swelling Adriatic seas:
        I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
        If wealthily, then happily in Padua</p>

      <h4 class="GRUMIO">GRUMIO</h4>

     <p class="paragraph">Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his
     mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to
     a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er
     a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases
     as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,
     so money comes withal.
     </p>

     <h4 class ="HORTENSIO">HORTENSIO</h4>

     <p class="paragraph">Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
     I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
     I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
     With wealth enough and young and beauteous,
     Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:
     Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
     Is that she is intolerable curst
     And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure
     That, were my state far worser than it is,
     I would not wed her for a mine of gold.</p>

      <h4 class="PETRUCHIO">PETRUCHIO</h4>

     <p class="paragraph">Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:
     Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;
     For I will board her, though she chide as loud
     As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.</p>

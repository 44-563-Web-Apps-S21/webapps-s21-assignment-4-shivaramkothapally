          <h2>The Taming of the Shrew</h2>
          <h3>SCENE II. Padua. Before HORTENSIO'S house</h3>
          <h4>description of play</h4>

          <h5>
            Instead, The Taming of the Shrew emphasizes the economic aspects of marriageâ€”specifically, how economic considerations determine who marries whom.<br> 
            The play tends to explore romantic relationships from a social perspective, addressing the institutions of courtship and marriage rather than the inner passions of lovers<br>

            PETRUCHIO
            Verona, for a while I take my leave,
            To see my friends in Padua, but of all
            My best beloved and approved friend,
            Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
            Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.
            GRUMIO
            Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has
            rebused your worship?
            PETRUCHIO
            Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.
            GRUMIO
            Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that
            I should knock you here, sir?
            PETRUCHIO
            Villain, I say, knock me at this gate
            And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
            GRUMIO
            My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock
            you first,
            And then I know after who comes by the worst.
            PETRUCHIO
            Will it not be?
            Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
            I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.
            He wrings him by the ears
            
            GRUMIO
            Help, masters, help! my master is mad.
            PETRUCHIO
            Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!
            Enter HORTENSIO
            
            HORTENSIO
            How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!
            and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?
            PETRUCHIO
            Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
            'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.
            HORTENSIO
            'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor
            mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound
            this quarrel.
            GRUMIO
            Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.
            if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
            service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap
            him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to
            use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,
            two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had
            well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.
            PETRUCHIO
            A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
            I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
            And could not get him for my heart to do it.
            GRUMIO
            Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these
            words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,
            knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you
            now with, 'knocking at the gate'?
            PETRUCHIO
            Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.
            HORTENSIO
            Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:
            Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
            Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
            And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
            Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
            PETRUCHIO
            Such wind as scatters young men through the world,
            To seek their fortunes farther than at home
            Where small experience grows. But in a few,
            Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
            Antonio, my father, is deceased;
            And I have thrust myself into this maze,
            Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:
            Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
            And so am come abroad to see the world.
          </p>

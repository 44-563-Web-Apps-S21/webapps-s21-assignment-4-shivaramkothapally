        <h3>SCENE II. Padua. Before HORTENSIO'S house</h3>

            <p class="paragraph">Instead, The Taming of the Shrew emphasizes the economic aspects of marriageâ€”specifically, how economic considerations determine who marries whom.<br> 
          The play tends to explore romantic relationships from a social perspective, addressing the institutions of courtship and marriage rather than the inner passions of lovers<br>

          Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
          I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
          'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.</P>

           <h4 class ="HORTENSIO">HORTENSIO</h4>
          
          '<p class="paragraph">Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor
          mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound
          this quarrel.</p>
          
          <h4 class ="PETRUCHIO">PETRUCHIO</h4>
          
          <p class="paragraph">A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
          I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
          And could not get him for my heart to do it.</p>

         <h4 class ="GRUMIO">GRUMIO</h4>
          
         <p class="paragraph"> Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these
          words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,
          knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you
          now with, 'knocking at the gate'?</p>

          <h4 class ="PETRUCHIO">PETRUCHIO</h4>
          
          <p class="paragraph">Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.</P>

          <p class="paragraph">Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:
          Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
          Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
          And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
          Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?</P>

          <h4 class ="PETRUCHIO">PETRUCHIO</h4>
          
          <p class="paragraph">Such wind as scatters young men through the world,
          To seek their fortunes farther than at home
          Where small experience grows. But in a few,
          Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
          Antonio, my father, is deceased;
          And I have thrust myself into this maze,
          Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:
          Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
          And so am come abroad to see the world.</P>

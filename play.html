          <h2>The Taming of the Shrew</h2>

          <h3>SCENE II. Padua. Before HORTENSIO'S house</h3>
          
          <h4>description of play</h4>

          <h5>
            Instead, The Taming of the Shrew emphasizes the economic aspects of marriageâ€”specifically, how economic considerations determine who marries whom.<br> 
            The play tends to explore romantic relationships from a social perspective, addressing the institutions of courtship and marriage rather than the inner passions of lovers<br>
          </h5>
          <p>
            PETRUCHIO<br>
            Verona, for a while I take my leave,
            To see my friends in Padua, but of all
            My best beloved and approved friend,
            Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
            Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.<br>

            GRUMIO<br>
            Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has
            rebused your worship?<br>
            PETRUCHIO<br>
            Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.<br>
            GRUMIO<br>
            Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that
            I should knock you here, sir?<br>
            PETRUCHIO<br>
            Villain, I say, knock me at this gate
            And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.<br>
            GRUMIO<br>
            My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock
            you first,
            And then I know after who comes by the worst.<br>
            PETRUCHIO<br>
            Will it not be?
            Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
            I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.
            He wrings him by the ears<br>
            
            GRUMIO<br>
            Help, masters, help! my master is mad.
            PETRUCHIO
            Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!
            Enter HORTENSIO<br>
            
            HORTENSIO<br>
            How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!
            and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?<br>
            PETRUCHIO<br>
            Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
            'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.<br>
            HORTENSIO<br>
            'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor
            mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound
            this quarrel.<br>
            
            PETRUCHIO<br>
            A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
            I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
            And could not get him for my heart to do it.<br>
            GRUMIO<br>
            Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these
            words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,
            knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you
            now with, 'knocking at the gate'?<br>
            PETRUCHIO<br>
            Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.<br>
            HORTENSIO<br>
            Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:
            Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
            Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
            And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
            Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?<br>
            PETRUCHIO<br>
            Such wind as scatters young men through the world,
            To seek their fortunes farther than at home
            Where small experience grows. But in a few,
            Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
            Antonio, my father, is deceased;
            And I have thrust myself into this maze,
            Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:
            Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
            And so am come abroad to see the world.<br>
          </p>
